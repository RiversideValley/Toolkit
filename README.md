Introducing **CubeKit**, the **ultimate** toolkit for building modern apps on .NET. **CubeKit** is a set of **versatile, platform-agnostic APIs** that enable you to build apps for **multiple platforms** using .NET.
Using a custom multi-target solution called Alloy, it exposes APIs that are suited to the project you install the aggregate package on, allowing you to **build apps for UWP, WinUI and .NET Core.**

**CubeKit** is a collaboration between [FireCube](https://github.com/firecubestudios), [Lamparter](https://github.com/lamparter), and [Ivirius](https://github.com/IviriusMain), combining the GlowUI, Ivirius.UI.Controls, CrimsonUI, and Riverside.Toolkit packages into one.

---

## Using CubeKit

> NuGet is a standard package manager for .NET applications which is built into Visual Studio. When you open solution in Visual Studio, choose the *Tools* menu > *NuGet Package Manager* > *Manage NuGet packages for solutionâ€¦* 

You can install all recommended helpers and controls using the [aggregate package](https://nuget.org/packages/Riverside.Toolkit) which automatically installs all the appropriate helpers for your target platform (.NET Core, WinUI and UWP .NET 9).
You can see examples of using APIs on the [documentation](https://riversidevalley.github.io/Toolkit) page.

The root namespace for CubeKit is as follows:
- `Riverside.Toolkit.*`: Main CubeKit components and helpers
- `Riverside.GlowUI.*`: Related to styles and GlowUI
- `Riverside.Extensions.*`: Various collections of .NET helpers and rewrites

CubeKit also contains controls from WCT 7.x that didn't make it to 8.x, such as `DropShadowPanel`.

### Building from source

It's recommended to read [Sergio's blog post on UWP .NET 9](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/ifdef-windows/preview-uwp-support-for-dotnet-9-native-aot/) to make yourself familiar with UWP .NET 9 NativeAOT and the limitations.

#### 1. Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) with the following individual components:
    - Windows SDK
    - UWP build tools
    - WinUI development workload
    - .NET SDK
    - [Preview Windows SDK bundle](https://aka.ms/preview-uwp-support-for-dotnet9-windows-sdk)
- Git for Windows

#### 2. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/RiversideValley/Toolkit
```

This will create a local copy of the repository.

#### 3. Build the project

To build CubeKit for development, open the `CubeKit.sln` item in Visual Studio. Right-click on the project you want to build and press 'Build'.

## Contributing

We're always looking for a helping hand, [look for open issues here](https://github.com/RiversideValley/Toolkit/issues) or create a [fork of the repo](https://github.com/RiversideValley/Toolkit/fork) to try or build new features.
Even just improving our docs and samples for existing components here, or adding new tests can be a huge help!

Check out our [documentation](https://riversidevalley.github.io/Toolkit) page to learn more about the project and how to contribute to it.

If you have a new idea for CubeKit, please write a [feature request](https://github.com/RiversideValley/Toolkit/issues/new?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen&template=feature_request.yml)! However if your idea is quite large and requires extra tracking, please [start a discussion](https://github.com/RiversideValley/Toolkit/discussions/new?category=ideas)! Any ideas for APIs, controls and styling suggestions are appreciated. No contribution is too big or too small.
